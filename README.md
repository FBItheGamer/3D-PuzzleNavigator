# Installation 5Y
The project is from the perspective of a facility electrical engineer who has been dispatched to the remote Installation 5Y. The Engineer (Player) must navigate through the quiet and semi-dark facility and test the security features such as PIN based door locks and various security clearances held by ID card holders. The facility may be inactive right now, but at one point it was, be cautious of what lies hidden in the bowels of the facility.
